# Playwright Automation with FastAPI

This project demonstrates a robust pattern for running synchronous Playwright browser automation tasks wrapped in an asynchronous FastAPI server. It provides a reusable `PlaywrightDriver` class, a specific automation task (`SauceDemoTask`), and two ways to run the automation: directly via CLI or as a web service.

The example task logs into [saucedemo.com](https://www.saucedemo.com/), finds the price of a "Sauce Labs Backpack," and returns the result.
